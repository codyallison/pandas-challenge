PyCity Schools Analysis:

1. Overall I believe we see two clear markers of success
-Charter schools outperformed District schools consistently
-Small to medium size schools out performed larger schools. 

2. Spending per student does not seem to have a clear advantage. Its in fact the schools that spend less per student have higher scores. 
-however most of those lower per student spending schools are also charter schools. 

3. School performance seems consistent across grades. 9th-12th all seem to have consistent scores

In my analysis I believe that the smaller schools are seeing the greatest success. Most of these smaller schools also happen to be charter schools. 
It would be interesting to analyze charter school practices vs similarly sized district school to see if this is a better indicator of successful test scores.
